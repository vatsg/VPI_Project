Terrain Reconstruction Project - Code

This is a C++ implementation of the algorithm described in: [Constructing and rendering vectorised photographic images
](https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/publications/constructing-and-rendering-vectorised-photographic-images) by Patterson et al.

The program takes an image as input, creates a contour representation of the image, and then reconstructs the original image by interpolation
from the contours.
